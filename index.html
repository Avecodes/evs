     <p1>An earthquake is the sudden movement or trembling of the Earth's tectonic plates, that creates the shakes of the ground. This shaking can destroy buildings and break the Earth's surface. A sudden shake underwater is called a tsunami.

        Earthquakes are caused by disturbances in the balance of the earth. Earthquakes are also caused by reactions that result from events that can't be seen operating beneath the Earth's crust.[1] An earthquake's first point of rupture is called its focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.
        
        People who study earthquakes are called seismologists.[2] There can be many earthquakes over a short period of time in a small area. The sudden release of tension in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, repeats, type, and size of earthquakes.
        
        Earthquakes are measured using watching from seismographs. The magnitude of an earthquake and the power of shaking is usually reported on the Richter scale. The Richter Scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. On the scale, 2 is scarcely noticeable, and magnitude 5 (or more) creates damage over a wide area.
        
        An earthquake under the ocean can destruction as the earthquake itself in mountainous areas. Earthquakes can also create landslides. Earthquakes are part of the Earth's natural rock cycle. The affect of an earthquake can be measured by a seismometer. It detects the shakes caused and it puts these movements on a seismograph. The strength, or magnitude, of an earthquake, is measured using the Richter scale. The Richter scale is numbered 0-10. The largest earthquake ever measured was a 9.5. An earthquake of 10 has never been recorded.</p1>
